## Leadership

### Rolando Posada, Founder & CEO

Bridge Public Schools is led by Founder and Chief Executive Officer **Rolando Posada**, an experienced K–12 system leader with a demonstrated record of launching, leading, and scaling high-performing schools serving predominantly low-income students. Mr. Posada brings nearly three decades of experience across the full continuum of public education leadership, including classroom instruction, school turnaround, regional management, and multi-state system oversight.

Mr. Posada began his career as a bilingual elementary teacher and quickly demonstrated the ability to drive strong academic outcomes for English learners and students from underserved backgrounds. His leadership trajectory includes successful campus turnarounds as a principal and subsequent promotion to executive and regional roles within IDEA Public Schools, a nationally recognized charter network. As an Executive Director/Regional Superintendent, Mr. Posada helped launch **30 schools in nine years**, built leadership pipelines, ensured compliance and operational fidelity, and oversaw academic systems that resulted in **100% of seniors matriculating to college annually** across his region.

As CEO of Bridge Public Schools, Mr. Posada is responsible for organizational vision, board governance alignment, school development, performance management, and financial sustainability. His leadership approach is grounded in disciplined execution, data-driven decision-making, and clear accountability—core expectations of Washington's charter accountability framework. He has extensive experience working within high-stakes authorizing environments and ensuring schools meet or exceed academic, financial, and organizational standards.

Mr. Posada's personal background as the son of immigrant parents and a first-generation college graduate informs Bridge Public Schools' unwavering commitment to equity, excellence, and results. His leadership ensures the organization has the capacity to responsibly launch and operate high-quality public charter schools that prove the possible for Washington's students.

**Every child. College bound.**
